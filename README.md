This project contains a series of scripts to create, access, edit, download, and delete Google Sheets.

# create_populate_google_sheet
This script is an example of how to use the ezsheets module to:
* create a G-Sheet in your  Drive, providing a custom name
* access specific worksheets within a G-Sheet and write data
* download a G-Sheet to your local machine
* delete a G-Sheet from your Drive

Before you use the ezsheets module, there are some additional steps that need to be taken to allow Python access to your Google Drive and Google API (see: https://pypi.org/project/EZSheets/)
